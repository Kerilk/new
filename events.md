This page will list events organized by CASS, CASS member organizations, and CASS software product teams.

Once built out, this will be similar to what the IDEAS Productivity website does for events (<https://ideas-productivity.org/resources/events/>), including interoperability with their event files.  However this is a lower priority compared to getting some kind of software product catalog in place.
